We will get the orientation data in radians from the Sense HAT on the Raspberry Pi board , this will be done by a server application which will open a socket in the localhost network and send the data every second once the client has established a connection to server,
The client will check for the thresholds and if that condition is not met will display a "X" on the LED Matrix in white colour and report the readings to Beebotte using the Python SDK (REST API).
In BeeBotte we have a dashboard to visualize the realtime change in yaw pitch and roll
